<h1>Delphi Books as open data</h1>
<p>Delphi-Books.com is a list of all (the most of) books published about Delphi, Pascal and Object Pascal. Some of the data displayed on our website are available through this API under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license.</p>
<p>Datas like authors photos, publishers logos, reviewers and reviews, table of contents and descriptions can't be shared because of intellectual property or by choice.</p>
<p>You can use our API for your websites or softwares but you can't distribute the datas to others as a separate product. If you use our API, please make a link to this website in the credits, legal information or on the pages where our datas are displayed. A classic &quot;Power by Delphi-Books.com&quot; with a link to https://delphi-books.com will be great.</p>
<h2><a name="samples"></a>How to use the API ?</h2>
<p>Our API gives you 3 datasets:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#dsboo">books</a></li>
	<li><a href="#dsaut">authors</a></li>
	<li><a href="#dspub">publishers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lists are available as JSON records of objects.<br>
Elements are available as JSON objects.</p>
<p>Each element has an &quot;id&quot;. It's the unique key you can use to access it.</p>
<p>Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format. YYYY for the year, MM for the month (01 to 12), DD for the day (01 to 31).<br>
Sometimes DD is equal to &quot;00&quot;. Sometimes DD and MM are equal to &quot;00&quot;. Please check them before displaying them.</p>
<p>Books languages are available as <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/fr/">2 letters ISO 3166 code</a>.<br>
If you need to display a flag for each language, you'll find them at https://delphi-books.com/img/flag/XX.png where XX is the language code in lowercase.</p>
<p>Please don't link to our images (covers, photos, logos, etc) except if you use them with our API.
</p>
<p>Use the links depending your programming language and its JSON library.</p>
