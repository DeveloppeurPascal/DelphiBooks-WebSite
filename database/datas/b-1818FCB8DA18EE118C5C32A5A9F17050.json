"text":"Delphi is a cross-platform programming language and software development kit that supports rapid application development for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Android, and iOS.\n\nWith the help of seven practical projects, this book will guide you through the best practices, Delphi Run-Time Library (RTL) resources, and design patterns. Whether you use the Visual Component Library (VCL) or FireMonkey (FMX) framework, these design patterns will be implemented in the same way in Delphi, using Object Pascal. In the first few chapters, you will explore advanced features that will help you build rich applications using the same code base for both mobile and desktop projects. In addition to this, you\u2019ll learn how to implement microservice architecture in Delphi. As you get familiar with the various aspects of Delphi, you will no longer need to maintain source code for similar projects, program business rules on screens, or fill your forms with data access components.\n\nBy the end of this book, you will have gained an understanding of the principles of clean code and become proficient in building robust and scalable applications in Delphi."}],
