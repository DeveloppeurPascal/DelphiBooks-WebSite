"text":"The missionThere are many programming languages out there. Most of them brag to be able to create cross-platform applications and to allow you to \u201Ceasily create rich GUI applications\u201D but miserably fail. In this book, we will actually achieve true cross-platform GUI applications with code that is 100% portable on Windows, Mac, Android, Linux, etc. I promise it WON\u2019T be a bumpy road!Your first Hello World application will be a single EXE file, few MB in size that will run on all major platforms without any additional libraries (Java, runtime DLLs, browsers, etc) required. For whom is this book?This book is specially written for * People that have little in programming * C++ programmers that want to switch to a more productive environment * Programmers that are advanced but never actually did GUI or cross-platform applicationsWhat you will learn * What is the best IDE\/compiler to develop cross-platform applications (modern, easy, fast, portable) * Basic programming skills * How to debug like a pro * Create GUI applications * Create less-buggy\/more reliable applications * Advanced debugging techniques"}],
