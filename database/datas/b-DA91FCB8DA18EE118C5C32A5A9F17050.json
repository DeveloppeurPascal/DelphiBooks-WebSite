"text":"<p>This book will be your guide to learning GUI Programming with Delphi. It will introduce you to the FireMonkey \u2013 a cross platform framework for GUI programming.<\/p>\n<p>The book starts with a brief intro on FireMonkey framework, by exploring its fundamental and architectural details and what sets it apart from VCL. We then move on to look at the FMX in details covering the aspects like, main components, style concept and elastic UIs. We then move on to look at how responsiveness is a key desirable feature and the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts while dealing with parallel programming and UIs. We look at cross platform services and platform specific features of the FMX framework before learning about the vector graphics and 3D functionalities.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the book you will gain insight into FMX framework\u2019s features, style, use of animation and so on to build effective UIs and achieve rich user experience.<\/p>\n<p>More infos in this <A href=\"https:\/\/authors.packtpub.com\/interview-with-andrea-magni\/\">interview with Andrea Magni<\/A>.<\/p>\n<p>You can also read Andreas' official release announcement on <A href=\"https:\/\/blog.andreamagni.eu\/2020\/10\/book-delphi-gui-programming-with-firemonkey-now-available\/\">his blog<\/A>.<\/p>"}],
