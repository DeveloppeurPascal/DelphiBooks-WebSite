"text":"This in-depth guide, by Delphi ClientDataSet expert Cary Jensen, shows you how to get the most out of Delphi's ClientDataSet, the Delphi component that provides you with an in-memory TDataSet. With this book, you will discover how ClientDataSets work, learn how to improve your software with powerful Delphi ClientDataSet features, master the art of cached updates, create cloned cursors, manage master-detail relationships using nested datasets, create in-memory data structures on-the-fly, craft structured, light-weight local storage, and much more. Based on the author's celebrated first edition, Delphi in Depth: ClientDataSets, Delphi in Depth: ClientDataSets 2nd Edition is newly updated for the most current versions of Delphi, and includes code samples using FireDAC, Delphi's most recent data access framework, and InterBase, the high-performance relational database that ships with every version of Delphi and RAD Studio. Newly added topics include LiveBindings, TDataSet.FieldOptions, and an extended discussion of filter expressions. If you are a Delphi developer, and do not already own the first edition of this book, Delphi in Depth: ClientDataSets 2nd Edition will make a welcome addition to your Delphi bookshelf."}],
