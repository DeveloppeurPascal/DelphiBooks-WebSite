"text":"Delphi is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports rapid application development for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Google Android, iOS, and now Linux with RAD Studio 10.2. This book will be your guide to build efficient high performance applications with Delphi.\n\nThe book begins by explaining how to find performance bottlenecks and apply the correct algorithm to fix them. It will teach you how to improve your algorithms before taking you through parallel programming. You\u2019ll then explore various tools to build highly concurrent applications.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019ll delve into improving the performance of your code and master cross-platform RTL improvements. Finally, we\u2019ll go through memory management with Delphi and you\u2019ll see how to leverage several external libraries to write better performing programs.\n\nBy the end of the book, you\u2019ll have the knowledge to create high performance applications with Delphi."}],
