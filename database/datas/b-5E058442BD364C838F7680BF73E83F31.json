"text":"<p>RESTful architectures are a key driving force behind modern API first application design. This book focuses on the RAD Server framework included with RAD Studio (Delphi\/C++Builder) for developing such platforms.<br\/><br\/>RAD Server is a full backend MEAP (Mobile Enterprise Application Platform) that enables Desktop, Mobile and Web frontend development in any language, and this book is designed as a definitive guide for developers.<br\/><br\/>The benefit of a MEAP is that you have a pre-built cloud or on-prem server with many core capabilities (such as push notifications, user tracking and analytics) that you can plug into rapidly to deliver remote database and functional access.<br\/><br\/>This guide to Embarcadero RAD Server, originally authored by David I (2019), is in its second edition, revised by Antonio Zapater (2023), which includes many additional features added based on market demand since RAD Servers Launch. The second edition is also supported by a comprehensive video series supporting each chapter, along with <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/embarcadero\/radserver-docs\">source code examples on GitHub<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/p>"}],
