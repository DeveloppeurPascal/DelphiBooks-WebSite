"text":"<p>Marco Breveglieri is an Italian software and web developer. He started programming when he was 14 and got his first home personal computer, a beloved Commodore 16. There were not a lot of games to play with, so he started writing some simple programs using BASIC language. These included a bare calculator, a fake harmless OS, a text-based adventure game, and a music cassette database. Marco spent a lot of time in front of a white and black screen creating software routines, many of which might have seemed useless to everyone but him.<\/p>\r\n<p>Going forward\u2014and getting serious\u2014years later he attended secondary school focusing on computer science, continuing that learning path and taking his first steps from BASIC to Pascal and C++. He earned his diploma and left school saying, \u201CI am so sick, I don\u2019t want to see another line of Pascal code!\u201D Then he met Delphi, and he loved it. Cosmic irony.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.syncfusion.com\/succinctly-free-ebooks\/delphi\/about-the-author\">More on this page<\/a><\/p>"}],
