"text":"Delphi 3 is a true object oriented, visual programming environment. If you need to write complex applications for Windows 95, Delphi is an excellent choice. Many professional developers considered that the user interface and the facilities that Delphi 2.0 offers were superior to any other programming environment. Delphi 3 has an improved user interface and offers many additional features. One of the most exciting recent developments has been ActiveX. Delphi 3.0 has all the tools that you need to develop ActiveX components. Essential Delphi 3.0 presents all of the key features of Delphi including database and ActiveX applications with many examples. The key events and methods, graphics programming, using Object Pascal, designing menus and debugging are some of the features covered. Essential Delphi 3.0 is designed for professional developers or students who need to learn the maximum in the minimum time and to develop applications fast."}],
