"text":"<p>This textbook is available in PDF and print(1200 pages). It covers structured and object-oriented programming in Delphi (version 7 to version 10.4) and is compatible with later versions.<\/p>\n<p>Delphi is based on Object Pascal which is simple and straightforward to use. Programming for mobile and tablet platforms as well as Windows and macOS X is covered in depth. 2D and 3D graphics are also covered as well as network programming and database programming.<\/p>\n<p>The book shows how to connect to and embed SQL in Delphi programs for a range of databases from Microsoft Access through Interbase to MySQL. Machine learning is addressed using components written for Delphi.<\/p>\n<p>The book shows how to program the Arduino microcontroller in Delphi to monitor temperature. Python4Delphi and anonymous functions also covered.<\/p>\n<p>This book is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.educational-computing.co.uk\/howtoorder.html\">available as PDF and printed edition<\/a> directly from the editor for cheaper price than on Amazon.<\/p>"}],
