"text":"In this paperback about Web Development with Delphi for Win32, the focus is on VCL for the Web, also known as IntraWeb.\n The manual starts with a brief overview of database normalisation, and in the first section covers the installation (or upgrade) of IntraWeb 9.0.x and possible problems and solutions.\n The second section covers IntraWeb in Page Mode, followed by IntraWeb in Application Mode in the larger 3rd section. The subsequent sections cover IntraWeb Client Side, IntraWeb and ActiveForms, IntraWeb and AJAX, IntraWeb Custom Components, the IntraWeb Testing Framework and finally IntraWeb Deployment.\n A special bonus section compares IntraWeb to ASP.NET.\n \n A more recent edition of the book can also be purchased in PDF format (with free updates and support) from my own website at <A href=\"http:\/\/www.eBob42.com\/courseware\">http:\/\/www.eBob42.com\/courseware<\/A>"}],
