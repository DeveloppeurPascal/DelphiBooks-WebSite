"text":"<p>Whether you\u2019re a curious novice venturing into the world of coding for the first time or already the user of a different programming language, this book is your gateway to Delphi coding.<br\/><br\/><a href=\"Delphi-in-all-its-glory.html\">The first book<\/a> concentrates on the exploration of the Delphi language. It doesn\u2019t matter if you never wrote a line of code \u2013 we will start from ground zero, but the process will be faster if you already have done some programming in other languages.<br\/><br\/>Even if you are a (young) Delphi programmer, you could still learn a few tricks from the first book (check the summary).<br\/>If you are an old-school Pascal programmer that was always afraid to switch to objects, I promise, this is THE BOOK for you!<br\/><br\/>The second book is for the more seasoned developer aiming to enhance their craft and concentrates on the more advanced topics, such as libraries and architecture design, compiler\u2019s and debugger\u2019s inner working, proper exception handling and most important safer code.<br\/><br\/><b>What will you learn from this book?<\/b><br\/><br\/>This is not the regular \u201Cprogrammer\u2019s manual\u201D kind of book where I show you the basics of programming and keep circling around stupid-simple code examples. While I do kick-start you into programming, the main purpose of this book is to take you to the \u201Cmeta\u201D level of programming and even deep beyond that. But while study the language as regular, mere programmers, we will learn in the background how to build stable programs through reliable code, how to avoid typical programming pitfalls, why some programming concepts are safer than others, how to turn mondain Delphi features into an error-prevention system\u2026<br\/><br\/>A second purpose of this book is also to demonstrate that Delphi is the best tool if you want to develop:<br\/><br\/>Good looking GUI applications<br\/>Cross-platform applications<br\/>Fast applications (for example data-processing, games)<br\/>Business and scientific applications<br\/><br\/>In parallel with all the above, we will compare Delphi with other languages (mostly C++, C#, R, Java, and Python) to see their merits and pitfalls and to reassure you that Delphi is THE language for you.<br\/>I will never ask you in this book to just believe me. I will always try to present hard evidence \u2013 scientific articles, proved concepts, read code examples, benchmark tests.<br\/><br\/>Even if the stakes are high, I promise it will NOT be a bumpy road. The learning curve might be steep in some places, but the book is peppered with code examples, case studies and diagrams that will explain the concepts we study.<br\/><br\/><b>Book layout<\/b><br\/><br\/>In the first book we have seen what kind of applications we can do with Delphi, then we dived quite deep into the Delphi language and object-oriented programming, and we saw what is safe to do and what is not, and most important, why. And in the background, we learned about high quality code, because in the end this is the ultimate goal if you want to more reach the Gods of programming.<br\/>The \u201Csafety first\u201D concept will be strengthened in this book where continue to learn about code reliability, designing sound architectures and preemptive programming. All this, while studying in foreground advanced concepts such as debugging, memory management, proper exception-handling, etc. Oh boy\u2026 we will have fun!&nbsp;<\/p>"}],
