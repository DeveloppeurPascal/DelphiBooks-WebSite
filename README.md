It allows you to add, modify or delete books, publishers and authors. Once you've made your changes, send us a PULL REQUEST. Please make one COMMIT per modification (per book added or per author, book or publisher modified).

If you add translations of texts using software or online services, please indicate their references and copyright, as some do not authorize the distribution of translated texts.
